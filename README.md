# Portfolio - Keith Ryan O'Rourke

Welcome to the repo for my web development portfolio! This readme is mostly intended to just point anyone who liked  my portfolio to the resources that I used to build it.

At this point in time my portfolio is a front-end only project, though I intend to add some back-end functionality to it in the future. (Side-note that I do have a full-stack project ON my portfolio!)
